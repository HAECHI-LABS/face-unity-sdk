# Face Unity SDK

Face Wallet is a non-custodial wallet that users who are new to Web3 can easily and safely experience Web3 with a Web2-like experience.

With the In-App Wallet format, users can perform blockchain functions by using the wallet without leaving the application in use. Developers can use Face Wallet's SDK to quickly integrate secure wallets with relevant applications. In place of difficult concepts of existing wallets like Seed Phrase and Private Key, users can effortlessly enjoy blockchain functions with familiar concepts like social login and PIN code.
